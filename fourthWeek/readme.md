# Algorithm Analysis Intro (PAA) 🖥️ 👨‍🔬

## Division and Conquer 🧩
  - Definition:
    - A powerful algorithmic paradigm used to solve complex problems by breaking them into smaller, more manageable subproblems.
    - It operates through three main steps:
    - Divide: Split the problem into smaller, independent subproblems of the same type.
    - Conquer: Solve the subproblems recursively until they become simple enough to solve directly.
    - Combine: Merge the solutions of the subproblems to form the solution to the original problem.
## Key Characteristics 🛠️
  - Efficient for problems that can naturally be divided, like sorting and searching.
  - Requires recursion as a fundamental tool for problem-solving.
## Classic Examples 🖥️
  - Merge Sort: Divide the array, sort each half recursively, and merge the results.
  - Quick Sort: Partition the array, sort the partitions, and combine them.
  - Binary Search: Repeatedly divide the search interval in half.

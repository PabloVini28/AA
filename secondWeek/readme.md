## Asymptotic Analysis 📈
  - Definition of Asymptotic Analysis 📝
    - A mathematical approach to evaluate the performance of algorithms.
    - Focuses on the behavior of an algorithm as the input size grows towards infinity.
  - Big-O Notation ⚪
    - O(1): Constant time.
    - O(logn): Logarithmic time.
    - O(n): Linear time.
    - 𝑂(𝑛^2): Quadratic time.
  - Growth Rates of Functions 🔢
    - log𝑛 < 𝑛 < 𝑛log𝑛 < 𝑛^2 < 2𝑛 < 𝑛!
  - Other Asymptotic Notations 📑
    - Big-Theta (Θ): Describes the tight bound of complexity (both upper and lower).
    - Big-Omega (Ω): Describes the lower bound of complexity.
